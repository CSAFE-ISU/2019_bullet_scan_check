# Bullet Scan Check

2019 REU Project - High-level checks of bullet scan quality

This summer, you'll be helping us to build a user interface to perform automatic quality checks of three-dimensional microscopy scan files. CSAFE, the Center for Statistical Applications in Forensic Evidence, is actively working to develop a method to automatically compare scans of bullets and cartridge cases; to do this, we need to make sure our scans conform to certain quality controls, which is where this project comes in.

## Initial Steps

#### GitHub

> Make a github account

This summer, you'll be using GitHub to keep track of code and other work you perform. Please [create a github account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one, and send your username to Susan so you can be added to the CSAFE group. [Here](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/git-and-github-a-beginners-guide-for-complete-newbies) is a guide on git and GitHub that may answer a few of your questions - you're free to take a look if you want, otherwise, we'll talk about it when you get here.
