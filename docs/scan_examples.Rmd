```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Breakoff
```{r, include = T}
list.files(file.path("figure", "problem_scans", "breakoff_issues"), full.names = T) %>%
knitr::include_graphics()
```

## Groove Engraved Areas
```{r, include = T}
list.files(file.path("figure", "problem_scans", "gea_scans"), full.names = T) %>%
knitr::include_graphics()
```

## Misaligned

```{r, include = T}
list.files(file.path("figure", "problem_scans", "misaligned_on_scope"), full.names = T) %>%
knitr::include_graphics()
```

## Tank rash or pitting

This probably can't be completely helped, as it's an artifact of the bullet itself, but here's what it looks like anyways:

```{r, include = T}
list.files(file.path("problem_scans", "tankrash_or_pitting"), full.names = T) %>%
knitr::include_graphics()
```
