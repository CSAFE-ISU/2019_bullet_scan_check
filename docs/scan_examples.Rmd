```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = F)
```

## Breakoff
```{r, include = T}
knitr::include_graphics(list.files(file.path("..", "docs", "figure", "problem_scans", "breakoff_issues"),full.names = T))
```

## Groove Engraved Areas
```{r, include = T}
knitr::include_graphics(list.files(file.path("..", "docs", "figure", "problem_scans", "gea_scans"),full.names = T))
```

## Misaligned

```{r, include = T}
knitr::include_graphics(list.files(file.path("..", "docs", "figure", "problem_scans", "misaligned_on_scope"),full.names = T))
```

## Tank rash or pitting

This probably can't be completely helped, as it's an artifact of the bullet itself, but here's what it looks like anyways:

```{r, include = T}
knitr::include_graphics(list.files(file.path("..", "docs", "figure", "problem_scans", "tankrash_or_pitting"),full.names = T))
```
